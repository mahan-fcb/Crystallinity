All raw file based on their classes are provided. 
Please note that the TR, SP, and balanced are extracted from these 5 classes of data.
This folder includs all datasets for different classes obtained from various sources cited in our manuscript. 
MF: sequencing failed; cloning failed; expression failed

PF: purification failed

CF: crystallization failed; poor diffraction

CR: structure successful; PDB duplication found

Please note that in the MF files we put both sequence cloning and production material failed because our model shows 100% accuracy for cloning failed. 

Also, there are some TR, SP, and balanced data for binary classification in the repository for those who are going to do binary classification.
