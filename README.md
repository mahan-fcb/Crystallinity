# Crystallinity
Crystallization propensity prediction by using dynamics-related features and AGT-GA 
All source codes for dynamic extraction from NMA and protein sequences are provided.

Also, AGT-GA for duynamic processing and models for processing of sequence and strucutral feature are provided.

AGTGA.py provides full model for dynamic feature extractions from dynamic graphs.

dynamic_preparation.py provides source code for dynamic graph extraction from the protein.

Main code properties.inpby is used for assembling sequential and steructural featurtes.

sequential_struc.ipynb is used for builidng a model for processing of protein sequence and structural features.
