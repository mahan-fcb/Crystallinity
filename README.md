# Crystallinity
Crystallization propensity prediction by using dynamics-related features and AGT-GA 
All source codes for dynamic extraction from NMA and protein sequences are provided.

Also, AGT-GA for duynamic processing and models for processing of sequence and strucutral feature are provided.
AGTGA.py provides full model for dynamic feature extractions from dynamic graphs.
dynamic_preparation.py provides source code for dynamic graph extraction from the protein.
